23 		<h3>Professional Ambitions</h3> 
24 			<p>I majored in Technical Communications at Eastern Washington University for the versatility that the program offers. I am prepared for my choice of careers, such as grant-writing, book/article editing, writing instruction manuals, social media content, talent representation, and so much more. I would like to focus on writing and editing, however, being a talent agent sounds like a lot of fun. 
25 			Education. My Bachelor's degree is in Technical Communications, and I plan on enrolling in a Master's degree program to enhance what I have already learned. I may add a slight variation by enrolling in a Communications/Leadership program, so that I will have even more versatility in career choices. 
26 		<h3>Career/History</h3> 
27 			<p>In my first career, I spent approximately twenty-five years in an office environment, usually in a managerial role. Towards the end of that career, I spent a few years as an independent contractor, setting up accounting systems for small companies, and training staff.</P> 
28 		<h3>Clubs/Organizations/Volunteer</h3> 
29 			<p>I became the Secretary for the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) club at Eastern Washington University for the 2014/2015 school year. It has been a learning experience, and a rewarding opportunity. From June-November 2014, I volunteered in the State Senate campaign office of Rich Cowan. Working there was my first experience with a political campaign, and I learned quite a lot while enjoying what I was doing.</P> 
30 		<h3>Skills and Relevant Information</h3> 
31 			<p>While writing and editing come naturally to me, I find I am a people person. I enjoy speaking with politicians, government office holders, and celebrities.</p>
